I used to think Daft Punk was a genre of music. Some hipster British term that was invented to describe an obscure type of punk that only six people listened to in London, but something that everyone else in the world pretended to love, ironically of course.

The night I learned Daft Punk was an actual band happened in May of 2013 while sitting on an old church pew smoking hookah with my friend Michael.

The Albatross was a local hookah bar I found myself at most nights after work. The Albatross was a dimly lit, smoke filled room that felt more like an old library in a basement than a hookah bar. A real shit hole, but with charm.

As I sat there waiting for my hookah to arrive, Michael was chatting with another regular about Daft Punk. It’s always best to never pretend you know something, and nine times out of ten pretending will just blow up in your face. So I butted in and asked,

“What’s Daft Punk?”

Thinking back on it, it probably sounded like I was having a stroke. It would be like asking me, “What’s The Beatles?” or “What’s Nirvana?” As Michael sat there trying to figure out if I was trolling or not, something they knew I did from time to time, he just said in a sarcastic tone, “You serious, Manhart?”

Michael was one of those rare people you click with instantly. I had only known Michael for a few weeks up until this point, but it felt like we had known each other for decades. Michael was the Albatross. He didn’t work there, but he had a private locker with his own hookah and accounted for the bulk ordering of the double apple shisha.

“Wait, you are serious?” he said after he felt sure I wasn’t trolling him.
“Dead serious,” I said.

Michael just let out a sigh, slapped both hands on his knees, stood up, walked behind the counter, and queued up Random Access Memories to play through the stereo.

As we sat there listening to each track with the soft bubbling of the hookah, I unknowingly made a memory with Michael that I will never forget. I remember his smile while watching me first experience “Giorgio by Moroder,” and I remember his chuckle when he spoke along to “but people call me Giorgio.”

Music has the power to act as a wormhole through the soul, and the ritual of a first listen can be spiritual. Experiencing those notes, verses, and choruses has the power to create a memory that cannot be shaken, and every listen thereafter is a ghostly reminder of that first listen. The night I learned about Daft Punk made a memory in my heart that will be with me forever.

My friendMichael passed away in 2015, just two years after the night he introduced me to this album. I never got the chance to tell him how much he meant to me during this chapter of my life. Every time I listen to this album, I think of him.
