Initilly I thought Daft Punk was a _kind of music_ and not a band. I can vividly recall the first time I heard this album and it always makes me think of my friend Michael everytime I listen to it now.

<br/>
It happend one night in May when I was sitting in the Albatross listening to two of my friends talk about how much they liked Daft Punk. Again, in all seriousness, I thought it was a British genre of music and a cheeky way to say silly punk or something.

<br/>

I was relatively new to this crew but my comfort level had grown high enough to ask a question that thinking back probably sounded like I was speaking a different language. I’ve always subscribed to the idea that pretending you know something is worse than just asking, “What the fuck is that?” There’s an honesty in not knowing, and this crew of guys was chill.

<br/>

"What's Daft Punk?" I asked.

<br/>

Now during this time in my life, I was very much "drifting". I was a few months post getting dumped after a five year relationship in my early twenties. I was in a reflective period of self discovery that most people go through in their early twenties if they are lucky, but for me it hit in my mid twenties. It felt like the lights had come on, but the room was still very much upside down in my life. I was very much still the new guy in this crew but sometimes in life shit clicks and you fit in like you were always there. The albatross was that place and the light had clicked on.

<br/>

Michael looked at me like I was crazy. Which makes sense this would have been like saying, “What’s The Beatles?”. He looked at me like I was speaking another language. Now, I had a growing reputation to fuck with people and troll from time to time, which was something you either loved or you were just a passerby during this period of my life. Michael loved this about me.

<br/>

To put Michael in the clearest context for millenials in a single sentence is he could be mistaken for the reincarnation of John Candy. Michael was that type of human.

<br/>

He filled the room with his enormous energy. Michael was also like the yellow stainedfurniture of the Albatross. It was a guarantee you’d see him sitting by the register in front of a sheet that was once yellow sheet (once white) that divided the main shop area from the pit where they packed and filled the hookahs for customers.

<br/>

This was Michael’s spot and always was. He’d be sitting there smoking his double apple hookah. Usually with a stout sitting beside the tower of his own personal hookah on the makeshift table of an old door. This wasnt where regulars sat. Its where Michael sat. Sitting in this very spot is where I asked again, “What’s Daft Punk?”

<br/>

“You serious, Manhart?”. . . again he thought I was trolling.

<br/>

After he was fully convinced I was serious, which I was, he stood up and walked behind the counter. No one gave a fuck, it was Michael. Michael queued up the album and pressed play. My hookah had just arrived at this point. Michael and I sat there side-by-side, him smoking his double apple and me hitting my usual guava mint, and I experienced my first listen to Random Access Memories by the band Daft Punk.

<br/>

Michael passed away in 2016 and I never got the chance to tell him how much he meant to me during this chapter of my life. A time when I was a floating cloud of smoke trying to make sense of things.Everytime I listen to Daft Punk or taste anything with the rich anise flavor ofdouble apple I think of my friend Michael.
