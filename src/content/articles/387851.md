## Rating

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
A masterpiece of the singer-songwriter genre. The album's influence on popular music cannot be overstated, and this German pressing does justice to the material with excellent sound quality.

## Additional Notes

The album features an all-star cast of supporting musicians including James Taylor (acoustic guitar), Danny Kortchmar (electric guitar), Charles Larkey (bass), and Russ Kunkel (drums). Many of these songs were already hits for other artists, but King's own versions here are definitive. The intimate production style lets each instrument breathe while keeping King's voice and piano at the center of the mix.
