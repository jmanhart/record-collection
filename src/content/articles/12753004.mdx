I am not sure when I actually picked up this album. I do know it was after I saw them perform in Springfield sometime in 2015. I’m not certain of the exact date, but I remember that concert vividly because it was the first concert I went to with my now wife, Li.

<br/>

I remember buying the tickets while I was on my lunch break, planning to surprise her later that night. Neutral Milk Hotel was one of her favorite bands (mine as well). When I came back into the office, an older account executive told me, “Well now you have to stay with her till after the show.” The show was still a few months away, but I remember that ringing clearly in my post-lunch brain.

<br/>

I had listened to this album before I met Li, and this is one where I don’t have a clear recollection of when, how, or who introduced me to it. It might have been sometime after my long-time college ex, when I was bouncing around the world making coffee and going to design school. Either way, however it came into my life, it’s still here and will be forever — which is the great thing about vinyl. These fucking things will last forever with a little love and care.

<br/>

As I sit here listening to the back half of this record and hear Jeff Mangum wail in Oh Comely, I’m struck by the range this album has. It pushes the limits of quiet to a colossal wall of sound on The King of Carrot Flowers Pt. 2 & 3. It’s also shocking that this album is older than I am by a few months. It doesn’t feel like an ’80s album.

<br/>

This album has zero skips front to back. It was one I played pretty consistently while working bar at The Coffee Ethic — a job where I wasn’t only the angry barista who would chat about anything for a dollar in the jar, but also the unofficial DJ while you studied or broke up with that partner in the annex near the back door for an easy escape.

<br/>

I didn’t break up with my wife after the show, to the disappointment of that account executive. We never had that awkward exit interview at the Ethic like the countless ones I overheard while working bar. In fact, we got married a few years later, and as the years go on this record keeps getting spun — one that we both know every word to.
